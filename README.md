# MeshGenerationInUnity
This C# script is meant to be used in Unity and it can generate a procedurally generated mesh. In other words terrain that is random but follows a certain pattern, so this makes the terrain seem like a more natural randomness. The function uses [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise#:~:text=Perlin%20noise%20is%20a%20type,1985%20called%20An%20image%20Synthesizer) this type of noise responds to a patern that can help us with creating this type of terrain. If you want some help on the topic here are some videos from [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG0uEXV6aHQ) and from [Sebastian Lague](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8).
